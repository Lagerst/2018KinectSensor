# KinectSensor_QT
Program used to gather data from Microsoft Kinect

	This program is designed to collect the coordinates of the skeletons of users.
	color image & depth image & Coordinate conversion function included.

To use this program, you have to configure a mountain of environments. 

	My environments:
	
		Kinect For Windows SDK v2.0
		
		Visual Studio Community 2017
		
		QT (version forgotten)

Trust me, it's a hard work.

Good Luck.
